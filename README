This is an Android application version of a web application made for COMP 3020: Human Computer Interaction 1
I worked on this project at the Local Hack Day in December 2016, and during spare time
Project can be run through Android Studio
Users must create a new account in order to view and use the application
The database is viewable to all users during the development phase
